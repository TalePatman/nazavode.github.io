Hi! I am Federico Ficarelli, I work as an HPC software engineer at the
[Italian National Supercomputing Center](http://www.hpc.cineca.it/) where Iâ€™m involved in several High
Performance Computing projects focusing on industrial R&D and scientific research. I'm interested
in programming languages (mainly C++, C, Fortran, Python, Go and some more), compilers,
weird architectures, concurrency paradigms and performance optimization.
When I'm not busy on code, I develop and print my own pictures in the darkroom.
