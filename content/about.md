Hi! I am Federico Ficarelli, I work as an HPC software engineer at
[Cineca](http://hpc.cineca.it/), Italy, where Iâ€™m involved in several High
Performance Computing projects focusing mainly on industrial R&D. I'm interested
in programming languages (mainly Python, C, C++ and Go), concurrency and
parallelism paradigms, distributed architectures and performance optimization.
When I'm not busy on code, I develop and print my own pictures in the darkroom.
