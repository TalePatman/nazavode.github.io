Hi! I am Federico Ficarelli, I work as an HPC software engineer at the
[Italian National Supercomputing Center](http://www.hpc.cineca.it/) where Iâ€™m involved in industrial R&D and scientific research. I'm interested
in compilers, weird microarchitectures, concurrency paradigms and low level optimizations, *a.k.a.* how to write and scale efficient code that *hopefully* doesn't suck.
