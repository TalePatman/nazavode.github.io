Just moved my [old blog](https://devnone.wordpress.com) to the combo that mixes
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the amazing
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.

What about the transition?

The porting process is actually painless: checkout one of the beautifully
crafted themes (I opted for [hyde-x](https://github.com/zyro/hyde-x) that looks
clean enough), tweak it a bit to fit your needs, convert your Wordpress posts
through an [html to Markdown
converter](https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/) and push everything to
the proper [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nazavode/nazavode.github.io).

The result is very promising.
