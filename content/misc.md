{{< bibitem title="SGI Standard Template Library Programmer's Guide" url="/sgi-stl-docs/" >}}
This is a snapshot of the original programmer's guide
for the C++ STL developed and shipped by Silicon Graphics until its definitive
end in 2009. It's still an extremely valuable resource: it covers lots of
foundamental concepts of generic programming as conceived back then by
[Stepanov](http://elementsofprogramming.com) and how they have been applied to a
real world code base. Since www.sgi.com isn't available anymore, I've just
grabbed one out of the many mirrors around and hosted it here unmodified. A snapshot
of the last source code release is [here](https://github.com/nazavode/sgi-stl).
