            <p id="hugo-list-item-subtitle">This is a snapshot of the original programmer's guide for the C++ STL developed and shipped by Silicon Graphics until its definitive end in 2009. It's still an extremely valuable resource: it covers all the foundamental concepts of generic programming as conceived back then by Stepanov and how they have been applied in the real world. Since www.sgi.com isn't available anymore, I've just grabbed one of the many mirrors around and hosted it here unmodified.</p>
