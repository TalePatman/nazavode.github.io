During the last meetup of the [Italian C++ Community](https://twitter.com/italiancpp) in
Modena, Italy I had the chance to give a talk about profiling C++ code. The whole game 
boils down to *understanding* what's going on when you have to cope with *very smart* 
optimizing compilers, NUMA architectures and speculative, superscalar CPUs: in this quest
for knowledge we are lucky enough to have some extremely useful tools like the *holy*
`perf` and micro benchmarks, using the excellent
[Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) for instance.

**It has been a lot of fun!**

You can find all the support material including examples and helper scripts
[here](https://github.com/nazavode/meetupcpp-dec-2018), feel free to grab anything
you happen to find useful. Oh, and the slide deck is
[here](https://nazavode.github.io/meetupcpp-dec-2018/).

Thanks to all the attendees and to [Marco Arena](https://twitter.com/ilpropheta)
for the chance to prattle on about some fun stuff I enjoy.
